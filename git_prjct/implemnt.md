### Aim: To initialise a repository locally and migratr to remote github location
+ Create a directory to initialise it 
  
![initialise Repo](/git_prjct/git_init.JPG)
+ When the  directory or path is initialised it is set to master, our next goal is to set it to main as the github always set a repo to main
+ We create and switch to a **main** branch `git checkout -b main` and 
+ Merge master to main `git merge master`
